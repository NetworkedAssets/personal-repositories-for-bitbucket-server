## Overview
Personal Repositories for Bitbucket Server is a plugin for Atlassian Bitbucket Server that helps you organise personal repositories in you Git instance.
Personal repositories are a useful tool, but if you are responsible for your company’s repository, especially if your user pool frequently changes, for example, because freelance developers come and go, you may not want this for everybody.  
And private repositories are not that easy to control from the administrator’s perspective: It is difficult to monitor how much space each user consumes for his personal repositories or to clean-up abandoned repositories of users who are no longer part of the organization. 
This can lead to large amounts of wasted disk space and unnecessarily large backup files on your Bitbucket server.
