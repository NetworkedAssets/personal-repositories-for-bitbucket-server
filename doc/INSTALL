The plugin will create two tables in your database.

Table name is AO_5D617F_GROUP
It contains a list of groups which are allowed to use private repositories.
To allow a group insert group name to the table.
i.e. INSERT INTO AO_5D617F_GROUP (NAME) VALUES ('employees');

Second table is there to keep the users allowed to use private repositories:

Table name is AO_5D617F_USER
It contains a list of users which are allowed to use private repositories.
To allow a group insert user name to the table.
i.e. INSERT INTO AO_5D617F_USER (NAME) VALUES ('user');
